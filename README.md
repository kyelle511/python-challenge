### Overview
For this challenge there are 2 folders- PyBank and PyPoll. Each folder contains a Python script (main.py), a Resources folder containing a csv file, and an analysis folder for the script created txt file. 

#### Part 1: PyBank
In PyBank you will find a Python script that analyzes financial records from a csv file and will then print the analysis in the terminal and creates a txt file with the analysis results.

I used (https://realpython.com/python-csv/) to help me figure out how to calculate the total number of months for the analysis. 
Special thanks to LA Robert Perron for helping me figure out the loop range correctly when creating the list of changes in profit/losses.
I used (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-maximum-values-position-in-columns-and-rows-of-a-dataframe-in-pandas/) to figure out the proper syntax for finding the maximum and minimum change values.

And I used (https://www.pythontutorial.net/python-basics/python-create-text-file/) to figure out how to create a txt file with my analysis results.

#### Part 2: PyPoll
In PyPoll you will find a Pythong script that analyzese election voting records from a csv file and then prints the analysis in the terminal and creates a txt file with the analysis results. 

I used (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24441606/how-to-create-a-list-in-python-with-the-unique-values-of-a-csv-file) to help me create the list of candidates, and then special thanks to LAs Peter Osipchuk and Jonathan Leverenz who helped me modify that code so that it also calculated a vote count for each candidate while looping through.

Thanks to LA Jonathan Leverenz who also helped me figure out a clearer way to code my printing of the voting results for each candidate. 

I used (https://www.w3resource.com/python-exercises/dictionary/python-data-type-dictionary-exercise-80.php#:~:text=Use%20max()%20with%20the,value%20in%20the%20given%20dictionary) to find the winner of the election.

And again used (https://www.pythontutorial.net/python-basics/python-create-text-file/) for creating the txt file with the analysis results. 

**And special thanks to TA Sam Espe for helping me add my gitignore after the fact and walking through me through the steps of getting my assignment synced into github.
